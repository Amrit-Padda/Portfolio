Here you will find some past projects I've worked on in the past. These were completed years ago and are simply for the curious :) :

## 'Final Project' is a project I completed for my CEGEP programming class.

The goal was to model a science related object and then use an optimization 
method to improve our topic.
Me and my partner chose to model a 0-60 drag race for an automobile and optimize the gear shifts using the bisection method. The motion of the vehicle was modelled using kinematic formulas, however the hardest aspect was modelling the launch of the vehicle. The variables in play were simply too great given the time constraints of the project and so we had to switch to a rolling start. This allowed us to focus on the optimal shift times for the vehicle. We then used the bisection method to optmize the model and determine the optimal time to shift gears.

The most difficult aspect of this project was determining the model itself, with help from our professor, we were able to determine a relatively simple model that would allow us to complete the project on time. 

When compiled, the code returns the following:

The best time to switch gears is at an engine RPM of 6392.85
99.88% of the red line
The time it took to go from 5.0km/h to 100.0km/h is: 5.234

## 'simulate.py' is a fairly simple script which uses a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal allocation of a portfolio.
